# Monster Fighter
A short videogame where you play a 'hero' that can either shoot arrows or
cookies at the 'monster'. The 'monster' moves back and forth at constant speed
and shoots fireballs as it moves. The health of the hero and monster print out
to terminal, but do not yet display on the game screen. Have fun!
